#  Decision Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked with using VS Code, SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Python with Pandas functions to review temperature data in order to provide a recommendation on whether an ice cream business would be suitable to operate all year in Oahu.

## Results
- The project compared temperature data from two months: June and Decemeber and revealed the following key differences:
- The minimum temperature for December was nearly 10 degrees lower than June
- The maximum temperature for December was only 2 degrees lower than June
- The mean temperature for December was 4 degrees lower than June.

## Summary
Based on a review of the data, the ice cream shop should provide consistent sales year-round. Due to the similar temperature for both months, I would recommend continued operation with a recognition that some December business may be susceptible to a cold front.
